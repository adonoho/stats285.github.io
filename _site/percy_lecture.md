<strong>CodaLab Worksheets: A Platform for Efficient Collaborative Research</strong>
<p align="justify">We are interested in solving two infrastructural problems in data-centric fields such as machine learning: First, an inordinate amount of time is spent on preprocessing datasets, getting other people's code to run, writing evaluation/visualization scripts, with much of this effort duplicated across different research groups.  Second, a only static set of final results are ever published, leaving it up to the reader to guess how the various methods would fare in unreported scenarios.  I will present CodaLab Worksheets, a new platform which aims to tackle these two problems by creating an online community around sharing and executing immutable components called bundles, thereby streamlining the research process.</p>
