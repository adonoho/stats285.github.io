Any question or concerns regarding these policies must be directed to [Ms. Nicole Cobb](https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/nicole-cobb) (Email: ncobb AT stanford.edu)


1. **Airfare** 
   * The route between origin and destination is the most direct and frequently traveled (i.e., no circuitous routing)
   * May be a nonstop flight if requested by the traveler 	
   * Does not require stays beyond the traveler's requested dates of travel  
   * Domestic travelers must fly Economy. If a domestic traveler wants to fly first class, he or she must provide the first class ticket as well as an economy comparison ticket for the same price. Stanford will reimburse whatever an economy ticket cost and the traveler will be responsible for the additional cost incurred for first class. 
   * International travelers on flights of 8 hours or more can fly business class, but should adhere to the other policies outlined above. 

       If a portion of your travel is personal, and you then will fly a different route, you need to save proof of lowest airfare for the direct route (screenshot of available fares at time of booking). Stanford will then reimburse the lower of the actual airfare for the route flown or the documented lowest available fare for the direct route.  

2. **Meals**  

   Stanford pays for reasonably priced and necessary meals during travel. Itemized receipts are required for meal reimbursement.
