# Assignment 01

In this assignment, you will learn how to run deep learning experiments using the **ElastiCluster-ClusterJob** computing model. In particular, each of you will build **your own personal SLURM cluster** on Google Compute Engine (GCE) using [elasticluster](https://gc3-uzh-ch.github.io/elasticluster/) and then run massive computational experiments using [clusterjob](http://clusterjob.org). 

Please follow the following steps to setup your cluster and run experiments. This documents only contains the detail of setting up your cluster and testing that it works properly with GPUs. Once these steps are completed, you should conduct your experiments as assigned to you on Canvas. The details of the experiment will **only** be available via Stanford Canvas website to students who are taking this course for credit.

# ElastiCluster-ClusterJob Computing Model


1. [Claim Your Google Cloud Credit](#part-1-claim-your-google-cloud-credit)      
2. [Implement ElastiCluster-ClusterJob model](#part-2-implement-elasticluster-clusterjob-model)   
3. [Run Your Experiment and Submit CJ Package to Canvas](#part-3-run-your-experiment-and-submit-cj-package-to-canvas)      



## Part-1: Claim Your Google Cloud Credit

* Claim your [$300 Google Compute Credit](https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/89001/discussion_topics/277314). You will also get $300 free credit from Google Cloud as a first time user by setting up your [Billing Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing). However, these 300$ allows only very limited CPU-only computation.

	
## Part-2 Implement ElastiCluster-ClusterJob Model

Follow instructions at [Painless Computing Models for Ambitious Data Science](https://monajemi.github.io/datascience/pages/painless-computing-models) to implement the ElastiCluster-ClusterJob model.


## Run Your Experiment and Submit CJ Package to Canvas

Please run the Deep Learning experiment assigned to you and submit the reproducible CJ package on Canvas.
