## Time and Venue 
The hackathon starts at 8:00 AM on Nov 17 and ends at midnight on Nov 18. The event takes place at [Wallenberg Hall-Building 160](https://campus-map.stanford.edu/?id=01-160&lat=37.42826985&lng=-122.16901666&zoom=17&srch=01-160). 


## Structure of the Hackathon
You will be divided into working groups of 4 people. Each group will have an external mentor (assigned by the instructors). Your mentors are experienced participants who will faciliate the collaboration and provide insights and guidance when needed.   


## Challanges
Please use the passcode you receive on [Canvas](https://web.stanford.edu/group/canvas/cgi-bin/www/discovery.php) from your instructor to log into [Challanges Page](https://stats285.gitlab.io/hack2018/index.html).


## Presentation and Prize
Each group must prepare a 10 min presentation about the challanges and the solutions they have addressed during the hackathon. One of the groups will be selected to receive a prize based on the quality of the presented work.
