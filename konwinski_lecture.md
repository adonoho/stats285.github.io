<strong>Data Engineering and Data Science with Databricks and Apache Spark</strong>
<p align="justify">Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data
processing. Since it was created in 2009 at UC Berkeley, Spark has
become the most popular open source data analytics framework today:
over 1000 developers from over 200 companies have contributed to Spark
and its committers represent 19 organizations.

In 2013 the creators of Apache Spark spun out of UC Berkeley to create
Databricks, a company that  provides a cloud hosted unified analytics
platform for Data Engineers, Data Scientists and Business specialists
such as analysts, managers and executives. Databricks also fosters the
Apache Spark community, donating millions of dollars each year via
open source code contributions and community stewardship efforts such
as meetup and conference planning.

Andy Konwinski is a cofounder of Databricks and a member of the team
that created Spark at UC Berkeley. He graduated from Berkeley in 2012
with his PhD in computer systems. In this talk Andy will introduce
Spark and Databricks, as well as demonstrate their use for analyzing
Data.</p>
