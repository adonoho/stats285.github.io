  <li>
    <p><strong>I have set up my cluster, but there is no GPU accelators that I can use.</strong></p>

    <p>Perhaps you did not edit your GCE qouta for GPU. You need to request an increase in GPU quota as stated in 
item 9 of <a href="https://stats285.github.io/assets/assignments/02/assignment2#part-1-setup-google-compute-engine">Setup GCE</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It is taking more than 30 min to build a cluster</strong> <br />
Have you edited your GPU quota before you run <code class="highlighter-rouge">elasticluster -vvv start gce</code> as stated above in item 2?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>I have received two credits from Google Education grants that created two billing accounts. How can I use both for my project?</strong>  <br />
You can change your projectâ€™s billing account by going to <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/billing">Billing Page</a>. You can associate a different billing account to your project as shown below.</p>
