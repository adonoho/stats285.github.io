<strong>Scaling Python to GPUs and Clusters: Dask and Numba and ideas for future work</strong>
<p align="justify">In this lecture, I will discuss how Numba and Dask help to scale the PyData ecosystem including NumPy and Pandas to GPUs cluster.  We will discuss the design of Numba and how it builds on the array-oriented foundations of NumPy and enables simple parallelization of compute kernels on the GPU.    We will then look at Dask and how it's design enables re-use of the PyData ecosystem while defining a standardized task-graph and approach to creating arbitrary parallel objects in Python.   Finally, we will take a look at the distributed schedule for Dask that has enabled Dask to scale Pandas-like and NumPy-like workflows to 1000s of machines using very similar APIs that users are familiar with.</p>
