<strong> IT infrastructure for research: a ongoing journey</strong>
<p align="justify">
Computers have been used for scientific research since they were
invented.  Up to recent times, two computational infrastructure
paradigms have been largely dominant: workstations/PCs for individual
researchers' and small group usage, and batch-queuing systems shared
across Departments for larger-scale computation.

With the recent availability of large data sets, especially in
disciplines that were not traditionally data-intensive, new tools
are needed -- that facilitate analysis of massive data sets and
fast validation of research ideas.  Flexibility of the
infrastructure is a key enabler here: we should adapt IT
infrastructure to the needs of data analysis, rather than adapt
our methods to the existing computational infrastructure.

Based on experience supporting research IT at the University of
Zurich, I would like to present a few scientific computing cases
and how they prompted us to evolve our computing infrastructure.
