<strong>IT for research: a journey from in-house HPC clusters to public cloud infrastructures</strong>
<p align="justify">
    Computers have been used for scientific research since they were invented.  Up to recent times, two computational infrastructure paradigms have been largely dominant: workstations/PCs for individual researchers' and small group usage, and batch-queuing systems shared across Departments for larger-scale computation.  When new disciplines start making heavy use of quantitative methods and rely on computers for their application, additional flexibility is needed in building and scaling the computational infrastructure -- can IaaS clouds deliver a solution that accomodates this new mix of use cases?  Based on my own experience supporting research IT at the University of Zurich, I would like to present a few scientific computing cases that prompted us to evolve our computing infrastructure.
